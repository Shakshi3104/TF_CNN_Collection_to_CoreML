# TensorFlow CNN Collection to CoreML

## Dependency
- `tensorflow 2.1.0`
- `coremltools 4.0b1`

### Caution

`coremltools 4.0b1` only supports TensorFlow 2.1.0+, but you can install TensorFlow 2.0.0 on macOS with `conda`. If you want to use it in a conda environment, we recommend that you create a virtual environment and install TensorFlow 2.1.0+ with pip.
